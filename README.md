## About

This project is designed to assist beginners in **Next.js** by sharing my personal knowledge and insights into key concepts of the framework. 

Here you can find **summarized notes** and **practical examples** about topics that can be hard to understand in the beginning, such as streaming and data mutations with Server Actions.

Also, I share the stack I've been using with some tips to speed up your development.

I hope I could help you at least a little bit ðŸ˜€
